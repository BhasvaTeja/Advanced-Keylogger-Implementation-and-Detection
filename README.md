# Advanced-Keylogger-Implementation-and-Detection


Keylogging is an act of tracking and recording every keystroke entry made on a computer, often without the permission or knowledge of the user.

Keylogger Detector - A software/ a program that can detect keystroke loggers. When antivirus software scans your device for keystroke loggers and other types of malware, it acts as a keystroke logger detector.

Keyloggers work by logging all the keystrokes and storing the file locally for a fixed period, after which they send the log file to the hacker through an email. Knowing this, we designed a Keylogger Detector that monitors the most used SMTP ports to detect the processes trying to communicate using email.
